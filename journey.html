            Filled with Adrenaline, the team wasted no time.
            The mission models were assembled in just 3 days by our excellent engineers.
            the team came together again after the 4th day and had got back in shape. 
            By the fifth day the team had been successful in accomplishing 2 runs, completing 4 missions which was huge
            as that played a huge role in getting them familiar with the overall work flow.

        <p class="times-para">
    while then rest of the team was working on the codes the rest, and others knowing what we were doing, 
    started to work on the innovation project.
    the team started to do their research.
    each one of us were suggesting ideas to eachother and making out alternatives from those ideas.
    then we thought of doing a bit of deduction. we started to look around and find items from which we could make our innovation project and wew did the same with the flll mission table
    then our coach, miss annum, initiated an idea to make an eco dome with that a podcast station within to talk about different educational topics.
    we muscled up and started building the eco dome.
    we finish in a bout a month or two and then set up the podcast station which was the easiest part.

        <p class="times-para">
        we were about to have our midyear assessments in december. 
        so for that reason we had to limit our staybacks which made us go a bit slow but we did come a few times in a month.

            The academic term had just come to an end aswell as the extra stress the team had been under due to the examinations.
            Moreover, a new member, Sher Ali, had just joined the team bringing high ambitions with him, 
            motivating the team to go ahead and give out their best. Followed up with an academic break, giving the team time to relax
            and focus on their personal lives aswell as come back fresh and ready for the upcoming competition.

            our main goal was to complete the eco dome and the podcast station and record a few podcasts.
            we had recorded a few podcasts with the parents, teachers, and memebers from our fll team. 
            one part of the team was working on the codes but was informed of every move made by the team working on the econ dome.

        <p class="times-para">
            The journey was coming to an end. It truly felt weird not having staybacks and 
            constantly thinking about new ways to deliver an impact in the competition and 
            make a mark. A lot of new friends made along the way and wayy more memories that everyone had gained.
            The experience we had attained was phenomenal as well as the new skills developed while doing the most important thing, 
            enjoying the journey throughout
