            Filled with Adrenaline, the team wasted no time.
            The mission models were assembled in just 3 days by our excellent engineers.
            the team came together again after the 4th day and had got back in shape. 
            By the fifth day, with the aid of our Captain Muhammad Ayaan Afzal the team had been successful in accomplishing 2 runs consisting of 4 missions which was amazing progress 
            that played a massive role in getting them familiar with the new season of FLL

        <p class="times-para">
    While half of the team was working on the codes, the other half, well assured that we were quickly progressing 
    began work on the innovation project.
    the team started their research in the form of a team-wide discussion.
    Everyone suggested their own unique ideas and a vote was held to choose the most promising ones. 
    We then worked on further developing the ideas until we came to one everyone was satisfied with.
    Biah Al-Khadrah. A GreenHouse and Podcast station Hybrid.
    This idea was suggested by none other than our experienced team Coach Miss Annam.
    Sleeves rolled up, we began construction.
    Within a moonth or two Biah Al-Khadrah was assembled and ready to start podcasting.

        <p class="times-para">
        With the help of our Co-Captain and Lead Coder Muhammad Hassan Ali than half of the Codes had been developed and tested to perfection. The team began rehearsing runs to make sure they could stay well within the 2 and a half minute time limit.
        But as the coding progressed to the other side of the board, the coders experienced their first hurdle.
        The Robot's design was not compatible with 2 of the biggest missions.
        Despite the setback rendering all of the previous coding virtually useless, the engineers determinedly began working on perfect the Robot/.
        The coders once again worked their magic, using their previous experience they managed to salvage the old codes and we were right back on track to complete all the mission.

        <p class="times-para">
        The Mid-Year Examinations were rolling around and team was running thin on energy. Most of us had dedicated hours to studying and revising for our exams and that had left us deprived of a will to do anything other than catch a few hours of rest and relaxtion.
        But knowing how important this competition was, we arranged time for a few staybacks on the weekends to atleast have some rehearsing and other odd tasks done while our website designer Muhammad Moeed worked on the team website from his home.

        <p class="times-para">
            The Examinations were over and our Mid-Term Holidays had just begun. We were all glad to have a break from the constant stress and studying of the exams.
            Some time to relax and layback was well deserved and well needed.
            After our break we came back with renewed enthusiasm as well as an extra member, Sher Ali. We were determined to show Sher a work ethic we could be pround of.
            Using the new motivation we progressed more than ever before and prepared ourselves for FINAL STRETCH

            The beginning of the end. The competition was drawing to a close. We spent every spare moment rehearsing and rehearsing until I swear I could have wrote the positions and sequences blindfolded.
            We were all nervous but confident in our expertise so we expect a pretty high score. Thanks
